# Repository for The Tech Academy for Python coding projects

This is a repo of the Python projects that were required while undertaking the Python course. The coursework had us familiarize ourselves with using TKinter for Python and also how to use DJango and get exposure of the Model View Controller concept.

The final drill for this course required us to read files from one directory on our local PC and write them into another directory.
